Nov. 2021 - Oct. 2022: Medical Image Processing



- Led and designed the project of automatically evaluating finger tapping videos of Parkinson‚Äôs disease patients. 
- Developed LSTM-FCN based model to classify patients. The result has 83.7% accuracy, which in dataset of this paper defeats the state-of-the-art results in literatures. 
- Utilized: Pose estimation (Mediapipe Hands), RIFE algorithm (Time Series Interpolation), LSTM, FCN.



July. 2022 - Sept. 2022: DGEMM: Double Precision General Matrix Multiplication

- Using 9 ways to achieve Matrix Multiplication, including methods of **Cache-oblivious** (Recursive) and **Z-Morton**.
- Testing Matrix size is from 16 to 2048, the best function is 82% faster than standard function.
