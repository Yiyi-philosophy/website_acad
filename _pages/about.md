# üî• News

*Oct. 2022 - (Now)*: Preparing for **ASC** (Asian Supercomputer Community)

*July. 2022 - Sept. 2022*: **DGEMM**: Double Precision General Matrix Multiplication

- Using 9 ways to achieve Matrix Multiplication, including methods of **Cache-oblivious** (Recursive) and **Z-Morton**.
- Testing Matrix size is from 16 to 2048, the best function is **82% faster** than standard function.


# üìù Publications 


*Nov. 2021 - Aug. 2022*: Medical Image Processing

![Figure01](about.assets/Figure01.jpg)

- Led and designed the project of automatically evaluating finger tapping videos of Parkinson‚Äôs disease patients. 
- Developed LSTM-FCN based model to classify patients. The result has 83.7% accuracy, which in dataset of this paper defeats the state-of-the-art results in literatures. 
- Utilized: Pose estimation (Mediapipe Hands), RIFE algorithm (Time Series Interpolation), LSTM, FCN.
